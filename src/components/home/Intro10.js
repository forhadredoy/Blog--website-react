            As we discussed briefly above, manifesting the building blocks is not only relevant to learning React, but to other technologies or programming languages as well. You can't build a skyscraper on a sandy foundation and expect it to be solid.

This might seem obvious to many of you, but I've seen developers who jumped into the intermediate or advanced concepts of React without really understanding the basics.

This also true for Javascript in general. I'm a huge believer that learning React doesn't make sense if you don't have a solid foundation in Vanilla Javascript.

So, if that sounds familiar to you and you're thinking about learning React but not feeling very comfortable with Vanilla Javascript already, spend some more time on strengthening Javascript first. It will save you a lot of headaches and time in the future.

Here's a helpful guide to the top JavaScript concepts you need to know before diving into React if you want to review.

But knowing the basics alone is not enough for me. It's kind of mandatory to know how React works under the hood. If you want to become a good React developer (which I assume you do, because you're reading this article), you have to know the tool you're using. This is beneficial for you as a developer and for your clients as well.

On the one hand it can save you a lot of time debugging your application. On the other hand it makes you more efficient because you don't have to take some steps back to re-learn the basics again and again. You basically know what you're talking about.

Of course, you can't know it all and you shouldn't stress yourself out on that topic. You'll learn more and more as you go through practical problems and build more projects. But with a good solid knowledge you are equipped well from the beginning.

Okey, that makes sense. But you might be wondering what exactly you need to know in order to have a solid foundation in React?

As a bare minimum, you should understand all the topics inside the Main Concepts Chapter inside the official React Docs.

Another chapter you should be very familiar with is the one on Hooks because they've become a convention and are used everywhere, especially in third party React packages.

Of course there are some you might use more often like useState and useEffect, but understanding the other ones like useMemo, useCallback or useRef is also essential.

There's also another chapter called Advanced Guides that I wouldn't consider to be mandatory at the beginning, but I'd highly recommend that you grasp those concepts during your React journey.

As always, it's often easier to understand advanced topics when you already have some practical experience. But the more of those things you understand early on, the better.

Of course you shouldn't limit yourself to just only following the React docs. Working through an online course that covers those building blocks, watching tutorials or reading other blog posts is also part of building a solid foundation. So, test what works best for you.

If I had to choose the most important concepts to know at a bare minimum, I'd suggest these:

what is "state"?
ups and downs of class and functional components
what are component re-renderings and how do they work?
how to trigger re-renderings
different component lifecycles and how to interact with them
Virtual DOM
Benefits of CSR (Client Side Rendering) and SSR (Server Side Rendering) in general and in React
Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Components
State Lifting
at least one global state management technology (Context API, Redux/Toolkit, Recoil)
Component Patterns  how to choose t
